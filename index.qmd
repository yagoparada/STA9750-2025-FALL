I'm a data enthusiast who loves turning complex data into clear insights.

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Statistics with a Data Science concentration at Baruch College**, and I expect to graduate in 2026. I’m looking forward to starting a career in this field.

A few fun facts about me: I love running and aim to complete the six major marathons, and I also enjoy finding vintage watches and giving them a second life.

On this website, you’ll find projects I completed during my master’s program.
